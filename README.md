Basic game framework setup for LÖVE for easier use
Successor to chip.lua built for Subpar Rhythm

I don't like how chip.lua was turning out so i kinda just
want to try again

> [!NOTE]  
> This only works for LÖVE 12.0 and above, you can download it from the main [LÖVE GitHub Repository Actions](https://github.com/love2d/love/actions) since it is currently unreleased.
